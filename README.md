# STanalysis
Future home of a simple, (hopefully) easy to understand spatial transcriptomics analysis pipeline for those who have never before done ST analysis.

This started as part of my masters thesis but has been continued as a way to provide some guidence to all of those trying to teach themselves some new NGS analysis techniques.
